In the above, we have been able to read a local JSON file. But unfortunately, when we run this in a browser, we might get the following CORS error because our file is not on a server:

To fix this, we will make sure our JSON file is on a local or remote server. If we use the Live server on our IDE, we won't get this error. But when we load our file directly, we will get this error.

As I said earlier, suppose we have this JSON file on a remote server and are trying to read this file in JavaScript. The same syntax will work:

<!--./index.js-->

fetch('https://server.com/data.json')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((json) => console.log(json));
The fetch API is the preferable method to use when we want to read a JSON file either from an external server or local file into our JavaScript file.


import data from './data.json';
console.log(data);

Unfortunately, this will throw an error saying we cannot use the import statement outside a module. This is a standard error when we try to use the import statement in a regular JavaScript file, especially for developers who are new to JavaScript.

To fix this, we can add the type="module" script tag in our HTML file where we referenced the JavaScript file, like this:

<html lang="en">
    // ...
    <body>
        <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
When we do this, we'll still get another error:

s_9630F87AB23B79DCD31DCDD0E14D2C6C4A3007934D2E561803A41CF5C1FE0085_1659465574774_image

To fix this error, we need to add the file type of JSON to the import statement, and then we'll be able to read our JSON file in JavaScript:

import data from './data.json' assert { type: 'json' };
console.log(data);
This works perfectly as long as we run our files on a local or remote server. But suppose we run this locally â€“ then we would get the CORS error.
